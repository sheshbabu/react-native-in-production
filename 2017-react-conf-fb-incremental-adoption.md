[Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUxHv-kH7w)

## How it's being adopted incrementally

* WebView conversions
  * Wanted to have native feeling
* Prototype quickly and test out product designs
* Features built but teams with React web experience but not iOS or Android experience
* Share business logic with web
* Share code between apps
  * Facebook and Instagram
